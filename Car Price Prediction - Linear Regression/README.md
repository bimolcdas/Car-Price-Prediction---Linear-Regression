# Problem Statement
A KOREA'N automobile company, is planning to enter the US market by establishing a manufacturing unit in the country. This initiative aims to produce cars locally to compete with established US and European brands.

To support this goal, Geely has partnered with an automobile consulting firm to identify the key factors influencing car pricing in the American market. Understanding these factors is crucial, as they may differ significantly from those in the Chinese market. Specifically, the company seeks to answer:

	•	Which variables significantly predict car prices.
	•	How well these variables explain car price variations.

Based on comprehensive market research, the consulting firm has compiled a substantial dataset representing various car types across the American market.

# Business Goal
The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts car prices using available independent variables. This model will enable Geely’s management to understand how price is influenced by different factors. With these insights, they can adjust car designs, optimize business strategies, and target specific price points. Ultimately, this model will help Geely better understand the pricing dynamics in a new market, supporting strategic decision-making.
